## Challenge - Ignacio Rodriguez Villasuso

This app was created based on the following criteria:

• Create a functional component named DataFetcher that displays data
obtained from an API. (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)

• Use the useState hook to store the data obtained from the API, ensuring
correct typing of the data using TypeScript.

• Use the useEffect hook to make the API call when the component mounts.

• Display the data in the user interface.

• Implement a dark theme for the application using the Context API and the
useState and useContext hooks.

• Create a context to handle the theme state.

• Provide a theme switcher in the application that updates the theme state
using the useState and useContext hooks.

• Ensure that the application styles change according to the selected theme
and use TypeScript to type the theme-related data correctly.

• Optional: Optimize the component's performance using useMemo,
React.memo, or useCallback to avoid unnecessary calculations or extra
renderings.

• Share the public repository or ZIP file once you have completed it.


In this project, I tried to create all the components and elements from scratch, without using any external UI tool (such as Material UI, Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.).

Also, I made some quality improvements, such as pagination for the posts and the IntroSection (with changing logo depending on the Theme).

This get this project going, you just need to run the following 2 commands

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

I hope the code is to your liking.

Thank you very much for your consideration!
